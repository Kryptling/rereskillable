# RERESKILLABLE
TL:DR - A simplified rewrite of Reskillable.

Rereskillable is a mod for Minecraft 1.16.5 that adds upgradeable skills and allows pack developers to lock different features behind those skills. Rereskillable is also compatible with Curios API - items that are put into curios slots will behave the same as armour.

This mod allows you to lock:
- Items
- Blocks
- Entities (SOON)
